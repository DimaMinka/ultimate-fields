	<h2 class="about-headline-callout">Improved repeaters</h2>
	<!-- <p>As everything else in version two, repeaters have been rewritten, improving performance and bringing new functionality.</p> -->

	<div class="col">
		<h3>Repeaters have tabs now</h3>
		<p>Using the same intuitive interface for creating tabs within containers, you can now create tabs within repeaters.</p>
		<p>Now groups with lots of fields can be nicely arranged and separated into sections.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="col">
		<h3>Full screen groups</h3>
		<p>If tabs are not enough or you want to use a repeater within a limited space, which is insufficient for displaying normal groups, you can use the full-screen mode, which is one of the coolest new features of Ultimate Fields.</p>
		<p>Now you can enable full screen mode for repeater groups.</p>
		<p>As you can see, full-screen groups also support tabs.</p>

<h2 class="about-headline-callout">Introducing virtual containers</h2>
<p>Virtual Containers are a new concept in version two of Ultimate Fields. A virtual container is not automatically associated with pages, options and etc. Instead, it can be used in combination with the new complex field type, with repeaters and with the layout field.</p>
<p>By doing so, you can reuse fields in different ways. With the complex field, you can combine similar fields (ex. button settings) and use them within multiple environments. If you are using repeaters for content builders, you could you re-use the same content block within different repeaters, meant for different places. The same applies to the layout field.</p>

		<h2 class="about-headline-callout">JSON Export/Import</h2>
		<p>Ultimate Fields 3 is now using JSON a lot, including for exports and imports, making it easier to select and migrate containers.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="col">
		<h2 class="about-headline-callout">Many new hooks</h2>
		<p>Ultimate Fields 3 provides more than 300 actions and filters, allowing you to change nearly all of it's aspects when needed.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="col">
		<h2 class="about-headline-callout">New website &amp; documentation</h2>
		<p>The time Ultimate Fields 3 required did not allow version one to get it's documentation. Now this is changed and there is a shiny new website. You can check it out at <a href="http://ultimate-fields.com/" target="_blank">http://ultimate-fields.com/</a>.</p>

	<div class="col">
		<h2 class="about-headline-callout">New layout structure</h2>
		<p>Ultimate Fields 1 only supported a tabular layout for it&apos;s fields. In version two, there is one new layout option, which places labels on top of their fields. When this mode is enabled, fields can have different widths, allowing you to lay your fields out in a tighter, better-organized manner.</p>
